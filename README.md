## Django Blog App
<p>This repository contains a simple Blog application built using Django. The application allows users to create, edit, 
and delete blog posts. The homepage displays a list of all blog posts, and each individual blog post has its own 
dedicated detail page. We also introduced CSS for styling and learned how Django works with static files.</p>
